# The Hut

The Hut is a website for a restaurant that houses a build in booking system so that customers can easily book tables at this secluded eatery. This nature adjacent restaurant with local fresh produce has everything a proper foodie is looking for, but due to it being so isolated it needs a presence on the world wide web. 

The site visitors will get informed about the menu and opening hours and can't resist making a booking on the bookingform on the site. The goal of the project when it comes to the admin of the site is to give them all the information they need on the admin page of the site. There they can also edit and delete bookings.
